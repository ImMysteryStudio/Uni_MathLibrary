//TODO:
|x| Vector3 default constructor and constructors that allow each float element to be set individually
|x| Vector4 default constructor and constructors that allow each float element to be set individually
| | Matrix3 default constructor and constructors that allow each float element to be set individually
| | Matrix4 default constructor and constructors that allow each float element to be set individually
| | Colour default constructor and constructors that allow each float element to be set individually


NOTES:
Vector4 are the ones used in graphics cards
They are more efficient for math use and allow Matrix4 to be multiplied by the Vector
Vector4(x, y, z, w) w = 0 -> directional, w = 1 -> point
Minumum requirements for assignment:

V = V + V (point translated by a vector)
V = V – V (point translated by a vector)
V = V x f (vector scale)
V = f x V (vector scale)
V = M x V (vector transformation) -> goes into Matrix class usually
M = M x M (matrix concatenation) -> //    //   //     //    //
f = V.Dot( V )
V = V.Cross( V )
f = V.Magnitude()
Normalise()
setRotateX( f )
setRotateY( f )
setRotateZ( f )
